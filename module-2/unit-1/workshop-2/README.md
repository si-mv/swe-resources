# Securing APIs with Basic Auth

## Assignment: MeMo

You wil build an app called MeMo.

Create two npm projects, one in a directory called `client` and another in `server`. The server should have an array of `users: []` and an array of `memos: []` which mock a database. In `server` you will build an api for the users to interact with these arrays; in `client` you will build functions and tests to interact with your api.

### User story

For users...

| As a... | I can... | so that... | Status |
| :---: | --- | --- | :---: |
| user | create an account with a `username` and `password` | I can sign in securely | :white_check_mark: |
| user | be assigned an `uid` by the server when I create an account | I can be identified uniquely | :white_large_square: |
| user | have my password salted and hashed on the server | I won't get hacked | :white_large_square: |
| user | update my `username` and `password` | I can keep my details up to date and secured | :white_large_square: |
| user | create a `memo` object in the array of `memos` on the server | save a string of content and retrieve it later | :white_large_square: |
| user | delete my own memos, but no other user can | control my data | :white_large_square: |
| user | read my own memos | know what my memos are | :white_large_square: |
| user | add `readers` to my memos | give read-only access to other users | :white_large_square: |
| user | remove readers from my memos | control who accesses my data | :white_large_square: |
| user | delete my account with all of its associated data | exercise my right to be forgotten under the GDPR | :white_large_square: |

### Hints

 - You could use (nanoid)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid] for creating `uid`s on the server.
 - When the user is created, the password should be salted and hashed and stored in the `users` array. You should use [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) for hashing (scroll down to the section on async - this is the best way). [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

### Extension 1

Write tests for your code in Jest. You could use unit testing to make sure your individual functions work, integration testing to see how the client interacts with the server, or end-to-end testing to ensure the user journey works.

### Extension 2

Add user roles to your app. Implement an `admin` role which can CRUD any user or memo. Admins can make other users into admins.
